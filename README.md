This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug: unexpected string concatenation due to loose typing. The bug occurs when attempting to add a number and a string. JavaScript's loose typing system will implicitly convert the number to a string and perform string concatenation instead of numerical addition. The solution shows how to explicitly type check or convert values to ensure the correct behavior.
